# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

## Overview
This README is the entry point for OctoAcme's project and program management documentation. It explains the purpose of the docs, how to use them, and links to the detailed process documents in this folder.

## Summary of Project Management Processes
OctoAcme uses an iterative, customer-focused approach that emphasizes small, shippable increments, clear ownership, risk management, and continuous improvement.

Core elements:
- Lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective
- Roles: Product Manager, Project Manager, Developers, QA, Stakeholders
- Key practices: small PRs and shippable increments, checklists for repeatable work, explicit owners for risks and decisions, regular syncs and demos, and a retrospective-driven improvement loop
- Risk & communication: maintain a risk register, weekly status updates, and clear escalation paths
