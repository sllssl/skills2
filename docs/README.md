# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's Project Management Documentation! This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for how we run cross-functional projects—from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

**Purpose:** These docs help teams understand our project management approach, roles, key artifacts, and best practices. They serve as a reference for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and stakeholders to align on how we deliver customer value efficiently and iteratively.

**How to use these docs:**
- **New to OctoAcme?** Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our core principles and lifecycle.
- **Starting a new project?** Follow the guides in order: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective.
- **Need specific guidance?** Jump directly to the relevant guide using the links below.
- **Want Copilot assistance?** Add relevant docs to `.copilot/` in your project repo so Copilot Spaces can use them as context.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

### Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible lifecycle for all projects:

1. **Initiation** — Validate business need, align stakeholders, create project one-pager, and obtain go/no-go approval
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, estimate scope, identify dependencies and risks, create release plan
3. **Execution** — Build, test, review, and iterate with daily standups and regular demos; track progress on project boards
4. **Release** — Deploy to production, verify functionality, announce to stakeholders and customers
5. **Retrospective** — Capture learnings, identify improvements, and feed insights back into future work

### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, dependencies, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success, and ensures customer value
- **Developers:** Implement features, write tests, collaborate on design, and help identify technical risks
- **QA/Testing:** Validate quality, verify acceptance criteria, and ensure features meet standards
- **Stakeholders:** Provide inputs, approvals, and business context

### Key Practices

- **Small shippable increments:** Deliver value iteratively with PRs ≤ 400 lines when possible
- **Clear ownership:** Every project has a named PM and Product Lead; every task has an owner
- **Checklists and artifacts:** Use project one-pagers, risk registers, and Definition of Done to maintain clarity
- **Risk management:** Identify risks early, track in a risk register, and escalate blockers proactively
- **Data-informed decisions:** Measure impact with success metrics and iterate based on evidence
- **Continuous improvement:** Hold retrospectives after each milestone and track action items to completion
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage feedback, learning, and transparent communication
